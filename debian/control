Description: Qt notifier for available upgrades, has a very simple upgrader
 Package includes a bash daemon (lubuntu-upg-notifier.sh) which
 checks if there are updates available. If there are it opens notifier.py which
 is a window that notifies about package updates available. If you decide to
 upgrade a full upgrade (not safe-upgrade) with the upgrader binary will take
 place.
 .
 Upgrader can also be run alone, it can be chosen to run cache update before and
 if a safe or full upgrade will be done. There is also a .desktop to call
 upgrader with cache update and a full upgrade.
